# Building-and-Evaluating-Advanced-RAG-Applications

Embark on a comprehensive exploration with the "Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG Applications" course, expertly designed by Jerry Liu and Anupam Datta. This repository is your all-encompassing resource, packed with essential files, detailed notebooks, and invaluable resources aimed at mastering the nuances of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of AI, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out by addressing the inherent limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) through innovative retrieval mechanisms. These mechanisms enhance the model's ability to generate responses that are not only accurate but also contextually relevant. This course offers a deep dive into optimizing retrieval techniques and meticulously evaluating the generated responses, ensuring the development of sophisticated RAG applications.

## Course Overview

This course promises a transformative learning experience, enabling you to:

- Master advanced retrieval techniques, including sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval, to elevate your RAG pipeline's efficiency.
- Embrace evaluation best practices for iterative refinement of your models, leading to the creation of a robust and reliable system.
- Thoroughly understand and apply the RAG triad—Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance—to evaluate the accuracy and truthfulness of LLM responses.

## Repository Structure

This repository is meticulously organized to guide you through the intricate process of mastering RAG applications. Below is an overview of the repository's structure, highlighting the learning materials and code examples that I have engaged with throughout the course.
